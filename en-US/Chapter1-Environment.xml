	<para>
		Development environment can significantly affect quality and security of code
and investing certain effort into proper setup can result in saved development
time, better code coverage, more readable and secure code etc. In general,
automated checks provide a good baseline and are less prone to unintentional 
mistakes than developers.

		<title>Code quality metrics</title>
		<para>
			Security is just one aspect of code quality along with reliability, correctness
and others. These metrics overlap a lot, for example denial of service can be
seen as both security and reliability issue. Therefore improvement in any of
these areas is likely to affect others.
		</para>
		<para>
			Increasing code quality by reducing complexity, duplication of code and
mainaining good readability is a good first step towards security. Many
security related issues are introducted by accident as result of complicated
code.
		</para>
		<para>
			Several gems can help with improving code quality:

        <para>
        	<ulink url="https://github.com/railsbp/rails_best_practices">Rails Best Practices</ulink>
        	is a popular gem among rails developers and new checks are implemented based on voting of community.

        <para>
        	<ulink url="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">rubocop</ulink>
        	is a style checker and implements vast amount of checks based on

      <listitem>
      	<para>
      		<ulink url="https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu">metric_fu</ulink>
      		combines several popular code metric tools like Reek, Flog, Flay, Cane etc.

		<para>
			These are just few examples and actual setup may vary from project to project.
			However, they help developers keep code complexity low in an automated fashion
			and can be easily integrated into workflow.
