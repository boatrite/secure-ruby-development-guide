  <title>Regular expressions</title>
  <para>
    A common gotcha in Ruby regular expressions relates to anchors marking the begninning and the end of a string. Specifically, <constant>^</constant> and <constant>$</constant> refer to the beginning and the end of a line, rather then a string. If regular expression like <command>/^[a-z]+$</command> is used to whitelist user input, attacker can bypass it by including newline. To match the beginning and the end of a string use anchors <command>\A</command> and <command>\z</command>. 
    <programlisting language="Ruby">
>> puts 'Exploited!' if /^benign$/ =~ "benign\n with exploit"
Exploited!
=> nil
>> puts 'Exploited!' if /\Abenign\z/ =~ "benign\n with exploit"
=> nil
    </programlisting>
