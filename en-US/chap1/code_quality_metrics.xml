	<title>Code quality metrics</title>
	<para>
		Security is just one aspect of code quality along with reliability, correctness
and others. These metrics overlap a lot, for example denial of service can be
seen as both security and reliability issue. Therefore improvement in any of
these areas is likely to affect others.
	</para>
	<para>
		Increasing code quality by reducing complexity, duplication of code and
mainaining good readability is a good first step towards security. All other things 
being equal, more complex code will have more weaknesses than simpler one.
